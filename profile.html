    <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
    <section id="interests">
        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p> 
        Being from Michigan, my interests include backpacking, biking, and rock hunting around the Great Lakes. I also enjoy picking blueberries and cherries, photography, and gardening. Beyond these interests, I'm a lifelong (aka long-suffering) Detroit Lions fan, and I watch all their games despite the pain they inflict on me.

        <h3>My Career Goals</h3>
        <p>
        Using the programming knowledge I have and will continue to acquire over the next several months, I hope to secure a job in tech. While I'm not yet certain which specific role or focus in tech interests me most, I aim to be a cooperative and driven member of the industry, working to find creative solutions to problems and continuing to learn at all times.
