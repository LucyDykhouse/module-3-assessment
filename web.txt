The internet is a global network of web servers, with each connected server having a unique address, known as an IP address. On the World Wide Web, servers communicate with web browsers using Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP. With this protocol, web browsers send requests to web servers, with the type of request determining the server response. Specific browser requests include but are not limited to: GET, which is used to ask for data; POST, which is used to alter a database; PUT, which is used to create a new resource at a specific place; and DELETE, which is used to remove a specified resource. The web servers then respond according to HTTP, usually with HTML markup that can then be rendered.
Thus, when a URL is entered into a browser, the hostname of the URL is converted into an IP address using the Domain Name Service (DNS). The browser can then connect to a domain name server and send a structured HTTP request with the resource and query argumnts of the URL. The web server receives this request and generates an HTML response. When the browser receives the server response, it reads and renders the HTML (and/or other code contained in the response), then closes the connection. This connection, request, and response process is repeated for each web element that is needed. When all of the elements have been rendered, the web page is completely loaded in the web browser.
