		<h1>About My Neighborhood</h1>

		<p>
		For the past three years, I've been living in the capital of Michigan, Lansing. While the dominant attraction of my neighborhood is an elementary school, greater Lansing and its sister city East Lansing offer a multitude of restaurants, parks, and events for people to enjoy. Check some of them out below!

		<h3>Parks to Enjoy</h3>
		<p>
			As a geology enthusiast, one of my favorite places to walk in Lansing is Bancroft Park. It's located on a preserved esker, which is a ridge of sands and gravels deposited by a glacier. These landforms are rarely preserved, so it's exciting to have one nearby!
		</p>
		<p>
			Another small park that I enjoy is the Tollgate Wetlands. It has a small half-mile walking loop around a native plants/animals preserve.
		</p>
		<p>
			Granger Meadows Park is a 75-acre park with fun for the whole family, including picnic shelters, sledding hills, and sports fields/courts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Lansing River Trail is a 13-mile walking, running, and biking trail that crosses through Old Town Lansing and passes major destinations like the Potter Park Zoo and Michigan State University.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rotary Park is a park that stretches along the Grand River. It has a beach area, a playground, and a kayak launch.
